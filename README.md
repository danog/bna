I created this script using http://employees.csbsju.edu/hjakubowski/classes/chem%20and%20society/cent_dogma/olcentdogma.html, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3HVVi2k2No, http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/the-information-in-dna-is-decoded-by-6524808 and http://misc.flogisoft.com/bash/tip_colors_and_formatting, feel free to check these sites out.  

I am by no means a biologist, so if you find any (horrible) misteaks in the script, please feel free to contribute by sending a pull request.
